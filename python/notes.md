Ideas for traceability
- Parse IETF RFCs into sections, paragraphs, clauses
- Generate an XML file that can be annotated
- Generate an HTML presentation of the annotated document
- Possibly use ReqIF
- Maybe implement a web-based editor for the annotated spec format

Annotated RFC
- XML format
- RFC text
    - Refer to SHA1 hash of plain text RFC
    - Automatic internal cross-references?
    - Automatic external cross-references?
    - Tag if SHALL/SHOULD/etc present
    - List of terms to be auto-indexed
    - Page anchors
- Notes
    - Design/implementation notes (text)
    - Testing notes (text)
    - Importance (should/shall/etc)
    - Implementation completeness %
    - Test completeness %
    - Tags
    - Internal cross references
        - Either file offsets or clause IDs
    - External cross references
    - Reference to implementation code
    - Reference to test code
    - Index entries for words/concepts
- OCaml documentation comments
    - Refer to clauses
- Convert to HTML
    - Float notes to the right of the RFC text
    - Note tags -> CSS class
    - Internal hyperlinks, including back-pointers
    - External hyperlinks: RFCs, code, tests
    - Collapsible sections?
    - Automatic TOC?
    - Summary of completeness, grouped by importance
    - Index of words/concepts
    - Index of multiple documents
    - Page anchors
